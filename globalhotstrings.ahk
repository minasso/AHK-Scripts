Hello! I'm Andrew the Tutor and my goal is to teach you EVERYTHING you need to know to prepare for your upcoming SAT and ACT exams!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABOUT ME
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm an HONORS graduate from Stony Brook with a dual BS in Math and Physics and I've been teaching test prep for nearly TEN years.

Throughout this time, I've developed complete MASTERY of the material in ALL sections of both exams.

I have worked for a number of different TEST PREP companies including: Kaplan, Princeton Review, SAT/ACT sense, LI prep and Atrium Educational. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This experience has taught me a few things:

1. The prices charged by top Test Prep companies are OUTRAGEOUS! (ex: Rates @ Princeton Review start @200$/hour)

2. I provide far BETTER service than nearly ALL other SAT/ACT teachers out there!
(Hardly any have the knowledge and experience that I have with one-on-one test prep tutoring!)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With that said, I would like to offer you the opportunity to study with one of the BEST and most affordable SAT/ACT tutors for a FRACTION of the price of the top Test Prep companies. 
 
Why overpay for underqualified tutors when you can afford to learn from the BEST??
 
I've helped hundreds of students of varying abilities set and achieve their scoring goals. Many of my students have gone on to be accepted by prestigious Ivy League schools including Brown, Cornell, and U Penn!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How does a typical online session work?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before the first session, all relevant practice materials (including 20+ practice tests and countless supplemental worksheets) are uploaded into a shared digital notebook that the student and I can both access at any time.
 
We start each lesson by working through the practice exam questions. As the student explains his or her ideas for solving the given problem, I write out the solutions directly onto my computer screen. The student instantly sees what I write via Skype's "screen share" feature and can later go back and review the material in our shared digital notebook.
  
Whenever we encounter an 'area of difficulty', we break from the practice exams to do a 'mini-lesson' to help get the student up to speed on that particular topic. We then use the supplementary worksheets to do targeted practice problems until the student demonstrates mastery over that material.
 
At the end of the session, homework is provided that is relevant to the topics that were covered in class. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To give you a better idea of how the online sessions will look, I've included a link to my YouTube channel:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have achieved FANTASTIC results using this online teaching method and both students and parents LOVE the convenience!

I look forward to helping you MAXIMIZE your potential and get accepted to the school of your dreams!
